# Wordle Vibes

A React-based Wordle game built with Vite, featuring a complete implementation of the popular word-guessing game. Built experimentally using "vibe coding" and human tweaked to taste. Includes features such as hints, word clues, and a scoring system. 

**Update**: With closer examination, a lot of the AI written code was muddled and buggy, as well as having built an unattractive UI. I have maybe revised 2/3 of the code now, so this is a human/AI collaboration. 

## Features

- **7 Guesses**: Players have 7 attempts to guess the correct 5-letter word
- **Color-coded Feedback**: 
  - ðŸŸ¦ Blue: Letter hint in correct position (0 points)
  - ðŸŸ© Green: Correct letter in correct position (2 points)
  - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Correct letter in wrong position (1 point)
  - â¬œ Gray: Letter not in the word (0 points)
- **Scoring System**: Maximum 10 points per word (2 points Ã— 5 letters)
- **Hint System**: Get hints that reveal correct letters
- **Word Clue**: Option to reveal a terse, wordcross style, clue (5 point bonus if one resist
- **Word Validation**: Only accepts valid 5-letter words from the dictionary
- **New Game**: Start fresh with a new random word
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Game Rules

1. Guess the 5-letter word in 7 tries or fewer
2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word
3. After each guess, letters are color-coded to show:
   - Blue: Letter is a hint in the correct position
   - Green: Letter is in the word and in the correct position
   - Yellow: Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
   - Gray: Letter is not in the word at all
4. Use the hint button to reveal one correct letter
5. Can reveal a word clue
6. Score points based on correct letters and positions

## Scoring System

- **Correct Position (Green)**: 2 points per letter
- **Correct Letter, Wrong Position (Yellow)**: 1 point per letter
- **Letter Hints**: 0 points per letter
- **Incorrect Letter (Gray)**: 0 points
- **Multiplier**: Score is multiplied if the word is guessed succesfully. The multiplier depends
on the number of guesses used, with 8 being guessed in one try, and decreasing
progressively to 2 if guessed in the last try.
